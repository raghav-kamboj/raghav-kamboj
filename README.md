## My 1st day at GNDEC!!

(source: My linkedin post)     

Excited to share a glimpse of my first day at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana! Today marked the beginning of my journey in Mechanical Engineering, starting with the Student Induction Program.

The day began with a serene Kirtan and Ardas at the College Gurudwara Sahib, setting a peaceful tone for what lay ahead. After a refreshing tea break, we gathered in the college auditorium for the inaugural ceremony. Before reaching the auditorium, the college provided us with a welcome letter, brochures, and other useful materials. 

It was an honor to hear inspiring words from IAS Harleen Parmar ma'am, an esteemed alumni of 2006 from the Information Technology department. Col. Bhupinder sir and Dr. S B Singh sir also graced the occasion, sharing valuable insights and words of wisdom.

The Student Induction Program is designed to help us transition smoothly into college life. Running from July 9th to July 27th, it includes various sessions aimed at familiarizing us with the college environment, academic structure, and essential life skills. It promises to be an enriching experience.

After the formalities, I took some time to explore the campus and made new friends from different schools and areas. The blend of modern facilities with rich heritage is awe-inspiring, and I can already feel the vibrant energy that this place holds.

Looking forward to the coming weeks of the induction program and making the most of this incredible journey at GNE!
